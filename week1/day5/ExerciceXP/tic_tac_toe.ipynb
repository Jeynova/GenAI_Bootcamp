    "\n",
    "    The game is played on a grid that’s 3 squares by 3 squares.\n",
    "    Players take turns putting their marks (O or X) in empty squares.\n",
    "    The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.\n",
    "    When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this project, you basically need to create four functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    display_board() – To display the Tic Tac Toe board (GUI).\n",
    "    player_input(player) – To get the position from the player.\n",
    "    check_win() – To check whether there is a winner or not.\n",
    "    play() – The main function, which calls all the functions created above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The 4 functions above are just an example. You can implement many more helper functions or choose a completely different appoach if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips : Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    What functionality will need to accur every turn to make this program work?\n",
    "    After contemplating the question above, think about splitting your code into smaller pieces (functions).\n",
    "    Remember to follow the single responsibility principle! each function should do one thing and do it well!\n",
