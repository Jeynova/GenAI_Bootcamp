    "ğŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Family and Person Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice working with classes and object interactions by modeling a family and its members.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Python Topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Classes and objects\n",
    "    Instance methods\n",
    "    Object interaction\n",
    "    Lists and loops\n",
    "    Conditional statements (if/else)\n",
    "    String formatting (f-strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Create the Person Class\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a Person class with the following attributes:\n",
    "    first_name\n",
    "    age\n",
    "    last_name (string, should be initialized as an empty string)\n",
    "    Add a method called is_18():\n",
    "    It should return True if the person is 18 or older, otherwise False.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Create the Family Class\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define a Family class with:\n",
    "    A last_name attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    A members list that will store Person objects (should be initialized as an empty list)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add a method called born(first_name, age):\n",
    "    It should create a new Person object with the given first name and age.\n",
    "    It should assign the familyâ€™s last name to the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It should add this new person to the members list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add a method called check_majority(first_name):\n",
    "    It should search the members list for a person with that first_name.\n",
    "    If the person exists, call their is_18() method.\n",
    "    If the person is over 18, print:\n",
    "        \"You are over 18, your parents Jane and John accept that you will go out with your friends\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Otherwise, print:\n",
    "        \"Sorry, you are not allowed to go out with your friends.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add a method called family_presentation():\n",
    "    It should print the familyâ€™s last name.\n",
    "    Then, it should print each family memberâ€™s first name and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once implemented, your program should allow you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a family with a last name.\n",
    "    Add members to the family using the born() method.\n",
    "    Use check_majority() to see if someone is allowed to go out.\n",
    "    Display family information with family_presentation().\n",
    "\n",
    "Donâ€™t forget to test your classes by creating an instance of Family, adding members, and calling each method to see the expected output.\n",
