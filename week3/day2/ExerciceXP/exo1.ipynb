    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 1 : Matrix Operations\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you’ll work with a 3x3 matrix. Here’s a brief explanation of the concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Determinant: The determinant is a value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix. It provides important information about the matrix, such as whether it has an inverse, and is used in various areas like linear algebra and calculus. To understand more about it you can watch this video.\n",
    "    Inverse of a Matrix: The inverse of a matrix is a matrix that, when multiplied with the original matrix, results in an identity matrix. Not all matrices have inverses. The inverse is crucial in solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a 3x3 matrix and perform the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculate the determinant.\n",
    "    Find the inverse of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 2 : Statistical Analysis\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you’ll calculate statistical measures for a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Mean: The average value of a dataset.\n",
    "    Median: The middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "    Standard Deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using NumPy, generate an array of 50 random numbers and compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The mean and median.\n",
    "    The standard deviation.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 5 : Image Representation\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",

    "Create a sample dataset to test the effectiveness of a new training program on employee productivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Productivity scores of employees before the training program\n",
    "productivity_before = np.random.normal(loc=50, scale=10, size=30)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Productivity scores of the same employees after the training program\n",
    "productivity_after = productivity_before + np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=3, size=30)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your task is to formulate a hypothesis regarding the training program's effectiveness \n",
    "# and test it using basic statistical functions in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset, formulate a simple hypothesis and test it using basic statistical functions in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 7 : Complex Array Comparison\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Create two arrays and perform element-wise comparison to find which elements are greater in the first array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output is a boolean array showing which elements in the first array are greater than the corresponding elements in the second array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "🌟 Exercise 8 : Time Series Data Manipulation\n",
