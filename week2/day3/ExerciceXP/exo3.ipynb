    "    Load the NYC Airbnb dataset.\n",
    "    Identify and handle missing values in multiple columns using advanced imputation techniques.\n",
    "    Detect and treat outliers in key columns like ‘price’ and ‘number_of_reviews’.\n",
    "    Create new features based on existing data, such as ‘booking_rate’ (number of reviews divided by availability) and ‘price_per_person’ (price divided by the number of accommodated guests).\n",
    "    Perform exploratory data analysis to understand correlations between newly created features and the target variable.\n",
